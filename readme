-Open up a terminal and run the following commands
1.pip install flask 
2.pip install psycopg2-binary

// pip is a package installer

-To confirm installation
->pip show package_name e.g pip show flask


PREQUISITIES
- SQL -> sql queries (crud),pk & fk, joins, where 
- Python -> data types, type conversion, data structures(lists&tuples),loops, if,functions 

Internet - a global network of connected devices or computers WWW - a service running on the internet that connects to the internet via the browser
Server - a computer device used for receiving / sending data from a client 
Hosting - Uploading application files to a server to make the application available or visible online



1.Build your applivation 
2.Send your files to a server
3.IP address is assigned to your application



IP address -> a number used to uniquely identify a device on a network e.g. 170.100.82.70

Domain name -> a user friendly name attached to an IP address to enable users acces applications eg www.google.com, www.netflix.com


DNS - Domain Name System -> The internet's phonebook used to translate domain names into IP addresse


127.0.0.1 -> The Ip address of your device / computer locahost -> domain name for 127.0.01



User application / Hardware <---------> Drivers <-----------> OS(kernel)(Keyboard driver)(Bluetooth driver)


Python code <---------> DB-API Interface <----------> Drivers(Psycopg2) <---------> DN (Postgres)

Psycopg2 
->A PostgresQL adapter used to connect Python to a Postgrs database--a driver -- connects Python code to Postgres


**host** - where is the db located ->on what server ->localhost(my own computer/device)
**port** - where exactly on my device is the postgres service running

 5432- default port for postgres
**user & password** - username and password used for authenticating a postgres login
**dbname** - database you want to connect to


**cur -> on object used to manipulate the database / perform db operation cur.execute() -> a function used to execute the actual sql queries 

C - Create - Insert
R - Read -  Select
U - Update - Update
D - Delete - Delets

cur.fetchall() -> fetches data from the query and gives it to python -> list of tuples


conn.commit() - updates the database with the new state

12 -> Products -> initial state -> add 5 products 17 ----> new state -- enabled by commit()

Task 1. Brush up on the following -> 
1.SQL querries
2.Joins
3.Python functions
4.Data Types
5.Type conversion
6.Loops
7.if statements
8.lists
9.Tuples


2.Research on other metthod appart from f-string to add products dynamivally ------> hint use => %s

3.Create Two functions to do the following ->

a.Insert 2 sales using psycopg2
b.insert_sales()
c.View my sales data using psycopg2
d.get_sales()




                   OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING
--> We have the following broad categories of classifying data types:
1. Inbuilt data types -
- Data types come with the programming language e.g Python --> int,float,str,bool,list,tuple,set,dict

2. User defined data types - are data types created by the programmer - enabled by the use of classes and objects e.g Person, Student, Car


OOP - A programming paradigm that builds programs around classes and objects 

**Classes** --> A blueprint or a template for creating object --> An instance of a class

-->A class has the following 2 things 
1. Attributes -> Variables holding data in a class
    ->Answers the queston: what does a class have? e,g Person - name, age,height,weight,martial_status,address etc class Car -engine,yom,make,model,colour etc class Laptop -width,ram processors


2. **Behaviour** -> Defined by methods 
 -> Methods are simply functions inside classes
-> Behaviour answers the question: what can a class do? e.g Person -walk,talk,eat,sleep,work class Car - start,move,stop class laptop -start,power off,code,send mail


**Methods** -Functions inside class
->Constructor - a special method used to intialize objects -> it is automatically called when an object is created -> Python's constructir is **init**--- def __init__(self,parameters)
-Self - refers the object itself parameters
- Parameters - attributes of the class


OPP Task 1.
1.Create a class BankAccount with the following attributes:
1.Account numbeer
2.Balance
3.Owner name
4.Date opened

2.Give the above BankAccount class the following behaviour or methods
1.Deposit()
2.Withdraw()
3.dispay_info()

3.Create a BankAccount objects that can deposit,withdraw and display_info
